My favorite short story is more of a poem. It is called "Two Headed Calf" and it was written by Laura Gilpin. In it, a calf is born with two heads.
<p></p>
It is destined to not live long, and although it doesn't have much of a future, it enjoys the beautiful night and spends time with its mother. 

This work of writing is filled with beautiful imagery and that is why I like it so much.
